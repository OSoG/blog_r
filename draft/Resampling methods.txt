Resampling methods are an indispensable tool in modern statistics. They
involve repeatedly drawing samples from a training set and refitting a model
of interest on each sample in order to obtain additional information about
the fitted model. For example, in order to estimate the variability of a linear
regression fit, we can repeatedly draw different samples from the training
data, fit a linear regression to each new sample, and then examine the
extent to which the resulting fits differ. Such an approach may allow us to
obtain information that would not be available from fitting the model only
once using the original training sample.
Resampling approaches can be computationally expensive, because they
involve fitting the same statistical method multiple times using different
subsets of the training data. However, due to recent advances in computing
power, the computational requirements of resampling methods generally
are not prohibitive. In this chapter, we discuss two of the most commonly
used resampling methods, cross-validation and the bootstrap. Both methods
are important tools in the practical application of many statistical learning
procedures. For example, cross-validation can be used to estimate the test
error associated with a given statistical learning method in order to evaluate
its performance, or to select the appropriate level of flexibility. The process
of evaluating a modelâ€™s performance is known as model assessment, whereas
model
the process of selecting the proper level of flexibility for a model is known as assessment
model selection. The bootstrap is used in several contexts, most commonly
model
to provide a measure of accuracy of a parameter estimate or of a given selection
statistical learning method.
