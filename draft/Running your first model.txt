Above, we read our data into a special type of data frame called a tibble. Data frames are the fundamental data structure in R. They hold the type of data you might think of as a table. This is similar to a sheet in Excel, or a table in a SQL database. Let's start by looking at a basic data overview with our example data from Melbourne and the data you'll be working with from Iowa.

    Tibbles are just data frames with some extra features that make them easier to work with. You can do everything with a tibble that you can do with a regular data frame, and they automatically take care of a lot of things that tend to trip folks up. If you absolutely, positively have to have a pl data frame, read your data in with the function read.csv() rather than the function read_csv().

The example will use data at the file path ../input/melb_data.csv. Your data will be available in your notebook at ../input/train.csv (which is already typed into the sample code for you).

Now that we have our data in R, let's summarize it!
